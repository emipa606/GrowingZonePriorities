Allows you to set priorities for which growing zone to sow and harvest first. Also works on plant pots, hydroponics, etc.

Save friendly!

v1.1.0.0 Changelog:
- Fixed bug where colonists would plant the wrong crop. (And probably some other bugs too).
- Simplified code so there is less performance impact and extremely unlikely chance of a mod incompatibility.
